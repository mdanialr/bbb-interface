### Params
> Request

`name` `string` `required`: A name for the meeting.

`attendee_pass` `string`: Password that would be used by attendee to enter the meeting. Optional. Would be generated by this service if not provided.

`moderator_pass` `string`: Password that would be used by moderator to enter the meeting. Optional. Would be generated by this service if not provided.

`max_participant` `int`: Set the maximum number of users allowed to join the conference at the same time.

> Response

`meeting_id` `string`: A meeting ID that can be used to identify this meeting by the 3rd-party application.

Third-party apps using the API can now pass createTime parameter (which was created in the create call), BigBlueButton will ensure it matches the ‘createTime’ for the session. If they differ, BigBlueButton will not proceed with the join request. This prevents a user from reusing their join URL for a subsequent session with the same meetingID.

`created_at` `string`: You know this ..right?.
